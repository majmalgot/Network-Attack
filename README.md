# Network-Attack
# Computer Virus Detection and Mitigation System

This Python project implements a computer virus detection and mitigation system using object-oriented programming principles. It includes classes representing various types of computer viruses and attacks, as well as mitigation techniques such as antivirus software, encryption, and network segmentation.

## Features

- **Object-Oriented Design**: Utilizes classes and inheritance to model different types of computer viruses, attacks, and mitigation techniques.
- **Virus Detection**: Implements an antivirus system to scan computers for viruses and detect potential threats.
- **Mitigation Techniques**:
  - **Malware Analysis**: Analyzes malware to understand its behavior and characteristics.
  - **Encryption**: Implements encryption techniques to protect against ransomware and phishing attacks.
  - **Network Segmentation**: Segments networks to contain and isolate attacks, limiting their impact.
  - **Patch Management**: Updates patches, firmware, and system software to mitigate vulnerabilities.
  - **System Isolation**: Isolates infected systems to prevent the spread of viruses and attacks.
